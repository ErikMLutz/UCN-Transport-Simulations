Notes on UCNtransport Code:

Options/Format for 'regions':
  [NB: Coordinate system oriented so that z => Horizontal Main Beam Direction and y=> Upward Vertical Direction]
  [NB: Terminate file with a line containing only '/'. Place no empty lines between entries.]
  
  Reg#: This is simply the unique number for the particular region defined. The first region should be called 0. Particles will be created in the cut-plane
        associated with this region if one calls poof(0,#,#). However, a particle generation plane may be defined in any region by calling poof(reg#,#,#). (The
        location of the particle generation plane in the region is the second argument-- see the function definition for more details. Also note that if you select an
        isotropic initial distribution you must specify some small offset from the region's cut-plane.) Regions that connect end-to-end using the '*' basepoint signal
        (see below) must always have sequential region numbers.
  
  RType: The type of region being defined
           1 => Box
           2 => Cylinder
         Note that while two connected cylinder-regions may have differing orientations, two connected box-regions as well as a connection between a box- and cylinder-
         region should NOT have different orientations. (An ERROR message will be output to the console, but the geometry will still be run.) Also, there is no error-
         trapping for attempting to connect same-type regions with different sizes and the same orientation. The program automatically handles box-cylinder and
         cylinder-box connections by assuming a lip whose material properties are associated with the region on whose cut-plane the lip exists, but for same-type
         connections with different sizes special handling code 5 must be utilized for the cut-plane separating the regions.
  
  BP(x,y,z): The coordinate of the center of the region's cut-plane. (A region's cut-plane is always defined at its upstream side.)
             An entry of '*' should be used for regions which are connected to the (downstream) end (i.e. opposite side from cut-plane) of the previous region.
             When defining a geometry that includes T's, define a set of regions that form a contiguous path from region zero to an end region using * entries, then
             explicitly specify a new basepoint and define another contiguous path using * entries. Continue until all contiguous sections are defined. Then, to
             indicate the interconnections (besides using a correct 'connex' file) do the following:
                  1) For each set of contiguous regions which ENDS in the side of another region, replace the '*' for the last region's basepoint with a '<'.
                     This indicates that that region terminates in the side of some other part of the geometry.
                  2) For a set of contiguous regions which BEGINS in the side of some region, place a '>' in front (no space) of the entered basepoint.
                     This indicates that the basepoint is the beginning of a new set of contiguous regions which starts in the side of some other part of the geometry.
             NB1: The program uses a box-region's y-dim to calculate the basepoint offset when a box-region is T'ed into a cylinder region, which should be kept in
             mind when defining the orientation of box regions in such circumstances!
             NB2: Region 0 should always be given a base point.
  
  Dim[m]: For a box this should 'xlength,ylength,zlength'
          For a cylinder this should be 'diameter,length', where 'length' is the distance from the centers of the region's cut-planes.
          All distances should be in meters.
  
  Orient: This specifies the three angles which define the orientation of a region. The format is 'psi,theta,phi' where the rotations are as follows:
                  1) Rotation around global y-axis through psi. (The global y-axis points up.)
                  2) Rotation through theta around the direction of the global x-axis rotated as in 1).
                  3) Rotation through phi around the direction of the global z-axis rotated as in 1).
          The angles should be in DEGREES. Note that the rotations are carried out in the order specified.
          
          Physically, psi allows you to change the orientation of a region in a plane parallel to the floor. Theta allows the beam direction to be aimed up towards
          the ceiling or down towards the floor. Psi then allows for rotations of the resulting geometry about the horizontal beam axis (i.e. +z-direction after the
          psi rotation but before the theta rotation). Note that the signs of the angles are via the RHR so that, for example, a positive theta will aim the +z-axis
          towards the floor. Also note that if a region with a non-zero phi orientation is connected to a straight section (i.e. a region with theta equal to zero),
          the straight section should be given the phi orientation of the previous region. (Subsequent straight sections may then have phi equal to zero.)
  
  Grad B: This specifies (constant) magnetic field gradients in a region of non-zero LONGITUDINAL (only) magnetic field. The format is: dB/dx,dB/dy,dB/dz
          where the directions (x,y,z) are such that they would coincide with the global coordinate system if the region orientation were psi=0/theta=0/phi=0 (i.e.
          the magnetic field gradients are to be defined relative to the region with z representing the longitudinal direction).
          Units should be [T/m].

          Note that gravity is automatically included in the -y (global) direction.

  Spec: The specularity for the inner surface of the region.
  
  Loss: Value of the loss-per-bounce probability for the inner surface of the region or, depending on loss model, the imaginary component of the Fermi potential.
  
  Depol: Value of the depolarization probability for the inner surface of the region.
  
  WPot[neV]: Value of the Fermi potential for the surface of the region (i.e. the walls), which should be in neV.
  
  BPot[neV]: Value of the Fermi potential for any bulk medium in the region, which should be in neV. Note that for scattering off the surface of a medium, the values
             (i.e. spec, SM, LM, losspb, DM, surf/scat, depol) for that region are used.
  
  Surf/Scat: Allows the specification of a surface parameter (e.g. a coating thickness, roughness parameter, or correlation length) OR the input of a mean free path
             (in meters) for the case of scattering in a bulk medium.
  
  Absorb: The probability of absorption due to interaction with a medium is calculated as 1 - exp(-a*T) where T is the total time for the particle's trajectory in the
          medium and a is an attenuation parameter (in units of 1/s) which is usually calculated as:
                                                      (cross section*v [m^3/s])*(particle number density [particles/m^3]).
  
  Det: Indicates a region which corresponds to a detector:
       0 => Not a detector region
       nonzero# => The region corresponds to detector number nonzero#
     
  PM: Indicates which propagation mode to use:
      0 => Medium has a Fermi potential as specified in BPot.
      1 => Absorbing Medium... used for absorption in detectors and deuterium.
      2 => Propagation through a foil... uses Golub's transmission formula which includes reflections from inner surfaces. NB: For thin foils the Fermi potential
           for the foil is the potential specified in BPot, of course, but it is assumed that there is vacuum on either side of the foil.
      3 => Bulk Medium which scatters particles... scattering is assumed elastic and isotropic with a mean free path defined in 'Surf/Scat'.
      4 => Bulk Medium with scattering and absorption.
      5 => Trajectory tracking for this one specific region is turned on.

  SM: Indicates which scattering model to use in the region:
      0 => Specified probability of specular bounce, diffuse reflection (cos-weighted isotropic) for non-specular bounce.
      1 => Probability of a non-specular bounce is (1-spec) weighted by the cos of the angle between the incident velocity and local normal.
           Outgoing distribution after a non-specular bounce is cos-squared weighted isotropic for the polar angle and random for the azimuthal angle.
      2 => TBD

  LM: Indicates which model to use in determining whether a particle is lost during a wall collision:
      0 => Specified probability of wall loss, no energy dependence.
      1 => Energy dependent loss-per-bounce (see p. 25 in Golub UCN book).
      2 => Energy and angle dependent wall loss using an imaginary wall potential and the Morozov formula (value of the imaginary potential to be specified insead
           of loss-per-bounce probability).

  DM: Indicates which model to use in determining whether a particle is depolarized during a wall collision:
      0 => Specified probability of depolarization.
      1 => TBD


Format for 'connex':
  In each line the first entry is a region number and subsequent entries are the region numbers to which it is connected.
  
  The connection list must be entered in such a way that the FIRST connection indicated for a region is the connection through the current region's
  cut-plane. Region 0 (the starting region) is an exception since there is no region connected to it through its cut-plane-- the first entry in region 0's connection
  list should be 0. (Note that a special-handling instruction must always be given indicating how Region 0's cut-plane should be treated.)
  
  Place an '/' in the first empty connection column.
    
  For each region specify ALL connections. For three guides connected end-to-end, for example, the 'connex' file would be:                                      0,1 0 1 /
                                                                   1 0 2 /
                                                                   2 1 /
  
  If a cut-plane requires special handling (e.g. part of it needs to be a reflective surface or there is a spin-flip resonance there), put a comma immediately (no
  spaces) after the cut-plane's region number in the first column of the 'connex' file followed by a (no spaces) special handling instruction identifier number.
  For example:        2,#  1  3  /
  would indicate that the cut-plane ASSOCIATED WITH REGION 2 (and which sits between region 2 and region 1) needs to be handled specially.
  
  Pre-programmed special handling codes are:
                                             1    => Cut-plane is 100% absorptive
                                             2(x) => Cut-plane is modeled with surface roughness. x (0,2] is a parameter passed to cplanes[reg][3] and defines a weighted probability distribution
                                                    for the amount that a particles bounce is deflected by the surface. Amount = grn()^(1/x) for x in [0,1] and Amount = grn()*1/(x-1) for x in [1,2]. x->0
                                                    will create a totally flat surface and x = 1,2 will create a surface which scatters particles isotropically into a hemisphere above it. (Erik Lutz)
                                             3    => Cut-plane represents a spin-flip resonance. Spin-flip efficiencies are defined in the handling routine.
                                             4    => Cut-plane is a monitoring detector (i.e. it doesn't absorb the particle) which records angular distributions.
                                             5    => Cut-plane separates two dissimilar-sized same-type guides where there is a lip.
                                                     The lip is taken to have the same material properties as the cut-plane's region.
                                             6    => Cut-plane acts just like the walls of its associated region.
                                             7(x) => Cut-plane has acts like the walls of its associated region except for a circular aperature in the center with radius x that acts
                                                     as if it has no special handing code. (This function to be used with cylindrical regions, no functionality for box regions yet).

Batch Mode:
  Batch mode is turned on with a flag in the header and allows any number of batches to be run with each batch containing any number of simulation runs. A specified
  set of geometry files is read in at the beginning of each batch mode so that geometry changes may be implemented at the batch level. Each simulation run in a batch
  allows one physics parameter to be changed. *Note that the changed parameter in returned to the original value before the next simulation runs. The physics parameter
  to be changed is specified by one of the following (case-sensitive) codes:
                                gradBx / gradBy / gradBz / spec / loss / depol / wpot / bpot / scat / abs / PM / SM / LM / DM
  In batch mode an additional output file is created for each batch which contains the integrated counts in each real detector for each simulation in the batch. The
  format for a batch file is as follows:

    
Number of BATCHES to run:
2

  where the '--------------' lines must be present to separate batches, but the number of '-''s is not important, the 'integrated counts filename', 'events filename',
  and 'detectors filename' can be anything you wish, and 'parameter name' should be one of the code names above.
