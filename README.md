# UCN-Transport-Simulations
Upgrade and use of Adam Holley's neutron transport code for use in the NCSU UCN project.

To Do:
GENERAL
  -Edit Transport Simulator.c to read a parameters file to set the rest of the parameters that are defined as macros in the beginning
  -Edit Visualizer to exclude error trajectories
  -Have batch simulations output each run to a separate folder
  
LEUNG SOURCE     
  
FROST SIMULATIONS
  -Edit Transport simulator to enable 108neV boost in random direction on contact with a cutplane: use for simulation of frost on surface of deuterium
