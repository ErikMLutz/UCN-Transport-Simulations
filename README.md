# UCN-Transport-Simulations
Upgrade and use of Adam Holley's neutron transport code for use in the NCSU UCN project.

Many of these codes (Transport Simulator, visualizer, events to visualizer trajectories, etc) are hardcoded to look for files of a specific name in their specific directory. Since this is the case, be careful about moving things around/copying files etc. It should be a first order of buisness to add functionality to each of these codes to choose input and output files before they run.
